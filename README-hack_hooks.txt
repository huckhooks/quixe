Goal: Have something to show current work to casual coauthors quickly. Inform7 fails utterly by lack of project-local extensions. (Or i failed to find it, but improbable).

Added:

History in url, bookmarkable. Copypastable to partners chat. Also replaces save, und back-button works as undo.

Browsies: Weblinks, iframes, images. Name based on feelies ;)
Done with special markup in say, not deep inform-extensions. Compatible to any client (will show raw hyperlinks there).

plug&play template for inform7-ide, copy ide/Hack Hooks Demo Materials/Templates, use: Release along with the "Custom-Quixe" interpreter.

Little intro-project demonstrates features. Editable with plain inform7-ide, uses extended quixe automatically.


Future (maybe): 

Shared input through server. Would allow multiplayer, all playing the same char. May be usefull to watch/chat with betatesters.


Notes:

Template copypasted from gnome-inform7.

build.py puts files there instead of in lib/

using prototype-1.7 because the old breaks json-arrays. in my firefox, same bug as described for safari.
